# Predictive Modeling of Real Estate Trends

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of real estate trends using a dataset encompassing various metrics across different regions in the United States. The project explores historical home values, correlations between metrics like home values and days pending, and predictive modeling to forecast price cuts based on historical trends.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project include:
- Analyzing temporal patterns and trends in home values across major cities.
- Exploring correlations between home values and other metrics to uncover insights into market dynamics.
- Developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast price cuts based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset (`USRealEstateTrends.csv`) used in this project includes:
- Historical data on home values, days pending, and other relevant metrics.
- Metadata such as region IDs, rankings, and geographical details.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- **Data Preparation and Cleaning:** Handling missing values, transforming data formats, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations between different metrics.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting) to predict price cuts and evaluating their performance.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation to understand data distributions.

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Huzaif101/US-Housing-Trends.git
2. Navigate into the project directory: cd real-estate-trends
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook
- Open and run the `Real_Estate_Trends_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter environment.
- Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualize the results.

### Python Scripts
- Alternatively, run individual Python scripts (`data_preparation.py`, `exploratory_analysis.py`, `predictive_modeling.py`) for specific tasks.
- Modify parameters and inputs as needed for your analysis.

## Results

### Key Findings
- **Temporal Analysis:** Identified seasonal patterns and long-term trends in home values across major cities.
- **Correlation Insights:** Discovered significant relationships between home values and days pending, influencing market dynamics.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Gradient Boosting showed superior performance in forecasting price cuts, leveraging historical trends effectively.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation to provide insights into data distribution and variability.

## Conclusion

This project enhances understanding of real estate dynamics through data-driven analysis and predictive modeling. It serves as a valuable resource for professionals and enthusiasts interested in real estate market trends and investment strategies.
